## Moving Squares

Write code to draw eleven (11) colored boxes on the screen. Each box should be 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels high. Draw each box in a different color and draw them at different places on the screen. It is okay if some of the boxes overlap. and use timeline to make them move every second.
